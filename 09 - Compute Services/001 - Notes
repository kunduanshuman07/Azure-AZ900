Azure Virtual Machines are computers that run in the cloud. They are like the computers that you have at home or at work, but they are hosted by Microsoft in their data centers. Azure Virtual Machines can be used to run a wide variety of applications, including web servers, databases, and development environments.
Azure VM Scale Sets are a way to create and manage a group of Azure Virtual Machines. They are useful for applications that need to be able to scale up or down quickly, such as web servers or batch processing jobs.
Azure Containers are a way to package and run applications. They are a lightweight way to deploy applications, and they are well-suited for cloud-based applications. Azure Containers can be run on Azure Virtual Machines or on Azure Kubernetes Service.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system, which means that it helps you to deploy and manage containers. AKS makes it easy to run Kubernetes on Azure, and it provides a number of features that make it a good choice for running containerized applications.
Azure App Services are a way to run web applications and APIs in the cloud. They are a fully managed service, which means that Microsoft takes care of the underlying infrastructure. Azure App Services are a good choice for running web applications that need to be highly available and scalable.
Azure Functions is a serverless compute platform that allows you to run code without having to worry about provisioning or managing servers. You can use Functions to create web APIs, process events, and respond to messages.
