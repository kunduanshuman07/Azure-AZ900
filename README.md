# Azure-AZ900
Notes and Materials required for this certification.


#Instructions to follow before you step into the Repo files:

1. Check the order , github lags highly in sorting the files based on numerals so check the file number and go from say file(1) - file(10) otherwise you will miss the understanding of the topics and get confused.

2. Open the Notes at last because the notes is more of a summary of the particular episode.

3. The best way to utilize the content is to download the repo ZIP and open the downloaded content in a text editor preferably VS code.



All the best.........->
