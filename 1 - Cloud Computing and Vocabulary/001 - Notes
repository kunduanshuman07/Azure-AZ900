Cloud Computing:
    Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to:
       a. compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
       b. storage like files and/or databases
       c. networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
       d. analytics services for visualization and telemetry data

Key concepts:
    a. scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
    b. elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
    c. agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
    d. fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
    e. disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recover from natural or human induced disasters
    f. high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
        availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)
